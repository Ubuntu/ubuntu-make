                        <li>
                            The software may include third party components with separate legal notices or governed by other
                            agreements, as described in the ThirdPartyNotices file accompanying the software. Even if such components
                            are governed by other agreements, the disclaimers and the limitations on and exclusions of damages below
                            also apply.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            The software contains third party components licensed under open source licenses with source code

            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>TERM.</strong> The term of this agreement is until 30/04/2016 (day/month/year) or next public release of the software,
                whichever is first.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>PRE-RELEASE SOFTWARE.</strong> This software is a pre-release version. It may not operate correctly or work the way a
                final version of the software will. Microsoft may change it for the final, commercial version. Microsoft also may not
                release a commercial version.  Microsoft is not obligated to provide maintenance, technical support or updates to you
                for the software.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>DATA.</strong> The software may collect information about you and your use of the software, and send that to Microsoft.
                Microsoft may use this information to provide services and improve our products and services. For this pre-release
                version, users cannot opt out of data collection. Some features in the software may enable collection of data from
                users of applications you develop using the software. If you use these features to enable data collection in your
                applications, you must comply with applicable law, including providing appropriate notices to users of your
                applications.  You can learn more about data collection and use in the help documentation and the privacy statement
                at <a href="http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=528096&clcid=0x409">http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=528096&clcid=0x409</a>. Your use of the software operates as your consent
                to these practices.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>FEEDBACK.</strong> If you give feedback about the software to Microsoft, you give to Microsoft, without charge, the right to
                use, share and commercialize your feedback in any way and for any purpose. You also give to third parties, without
                charge, any patent rights needed for their products, technologies and services to use or interface with any specific
                parts of a Microsoft software or service that includes the feedback. You will not give feedback that is subject to a
                license that requires Microsoft to license its software or documentation to third parties because we include your
                feedback in them. These rights survive this agreement.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>SCOPE OF LICENSE.</strong> The software is licensed, not sold. This agreement only gives you some rights to use the
                software. Microsoft reserves all other rights. Unless applicable law gives you more rights despite this limitation, you
                may use the software only as expressly permitted in this agreement. In doing so, you must comply with any technical
                limitations in the software that only allow you to use it in certain ways. You may not
                <ul>
                    <li>work around any technical limitations in the software;</li>
                    <li>
                        reverse engineer, decompile or disassemble the software, or otherwise attempt to derive the source code for the
                        software except, and solely to the extent: (i) permitted by applicable law, despite this limitation; or (ii) required
                        to debug changes to any libraries licensed under the GNU Lesser General Public License which are included with
                        and linked to by the software;
                    </li>
                    <li>remove, minimize, block or modify any notices of Microsoft or its suppliers  in the software;</li>
                    <li>use the software in any way that is against the law; or</li>
                    <li>
                        share, publish, or lend the software, or provide it as a hosted solution for others to use, or transfer the software
                        or this agreement to any third party.
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>SUPPORT SERVICES.</strong> Because this software is as is, we may not provide support services for it.</li>
            <li>
                <strong>ENTIRE AGREEMENT.</strong> This agreement, and the terms for supplements, updates, Internet-based services and
                support services that you use, are the entire agreement for the software and support services.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>EXPORT RESTRICTIONS.</strong> Microsoft software, online services, professional services and related technology are
                subject to U.S. export jurisdiction. You must comply with all applicable international and national laws including the
                U.S. Export Administration Regulations, the International Traffic in Arms Regulations, Office of Foreign Assets Control
                sanction programs, and end-user, end use and destination restrictions by the U.S. and other governments related to
                Microsoft products, services and technologies.   For additional information, see <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/exporting">http://www.microsoft.com/exporting</a>.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>APPLICABLE LAW.</strong>  If you acquired the software in the United States, Washington law applies to interpretation of
                and claims for breach of this agreement, and the laws of the state where you live apply to all other claims. If you
                acquired the software in any other country, its laws apply.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>LEGAL EFFECT.</strong> This agreement describes certain legal rights. You may have other rights under the laws of your
                state or country. This agreement does not change your rights under the laws of your state or country if the laws of
                your state or country do not permit it to do so. Without limitation of the foregoing, for Australia, <strong>
                    YOU HAVE
                    STATUTORY GUARANTEES UNDER THE AUSTRALIAN CONSUMER LAW AND NOTHING IN THESE TERMS IS INTENDED TO AFFECT THOSE RIGHTS.
                </strong>
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>
                    DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY. THE SOFTWARE IS LICENSED AS-IS. YOU BEAR THE RISK OF USING IT.
                    MICROSOFT GIVES NO EXPRESS WARRANTIES, GUARANTEES OR CONDITIONS. TO THE EXTENT
                    PERMITTED UNDER YOUR LOCAL LAWS, MICROSOFT EXCLUDES THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF
                    MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NON-INFRINGEMENT.
                </strong>
            </li>
            <li>
                    <strong>
                        LIMITATION ON AND EXCLUSION OF DAMAGES. YOU CAN RECOVER FROM MICROSOFT AND ITS
                        SUPPLIERS ONLY DIRECT DAMAGES UP TO U.S. $5.00. YOU CANNOT RECOVER ANY OTHER DAMAGES,
                        INCLUDING CONSEQUENTIAL, LOST PROFITS, SPECIAL, INDIRECT OR INCIDENTAL DAMAGES.
                    </strong>
                    <p>
                    This limitation applies to (a) anything related to the software, services, content (including code) on third party
                    Internet sites, or third party applications; and (b) claims for breach of contract, breach of warranty, guarantee or
                    condition, strict liability, negligence, or other tort to the extent permitted by applicable law.
                    It also applies even if Microsoft knew or should have known about the possibility of the damages. The above
                    limitation or exclusion may not apply to you because your state or country may not allow the exclusion or limitation of
                    incidental, consequential or other damages.
