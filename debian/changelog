  * Addition for the test jenkins server:
    - Add helper to display binary depends
    - Output xml tests and coverage report
    - Add xunit artefacts support in runtests
  * Some tests enhancement for working in the daily jenkins environment:
    - Change installing in conflict package prediction.
    - Give some time for the container in medium tests to start
    - Remove full install timeout logic. Instead, have a timeout if there
      is no new stdout/progress report change for a while. This ensure
      less flakyness in case of really slow network.
    - Remove on output testing first INFO message detection as it's a false
      positive.
  * No output by default when running tests:
    - Coverage tests doesn't print any stdout or logging info unless a tests
      is failing.
    - Debug profile is using the debug logging configuraiton as well.
    - Don't rely on importing tests/__init__.py to define logging format for
      nose.
    - Ensure subprocess (medium/large tests) set the same logging level as well.
    - Add a stdout hanlder in subprocess as well while testing (using
      the correct profile and be able to detect warning/errors)
  * debian/rules:
    - no need for --no-config for running tests anymore
  * Misc cleanups:
    - some refactoring of runtests

    - removed unused profile options
    - update documentation for the new logging profiles change.
  * Have pep8 tests passing on system version as well.

    translators!
